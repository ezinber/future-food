A University of Massachusetts <a href="https://foodinstitute.com/focus/qa-plant-based-menu-innovations-college-students-love/" class="section__link hover-opacity">student dining survey</a> found that students are asking for more plant-based menu items, including burgers, grounds, sausages, pizza toppings etc. Plant-based breakfast options were found to be popular both among vegans and omnivores.
